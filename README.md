This is the stable release for a web application I built that I call the "Heat Wave Web Application"

I built this app from beginning to end as part of my summer internship with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Climate Program Office during the Summer of 2016. I worked under the mentorship of Special Projects manager Hunter Jones and NIHHIS
Director Juli Trtanj. NIHHIS is part of integreated information systems with is directed by Dr. Wayne Higgins.

The online web application is available at http://ginali.xyz/NIHHIS.

To run and view this code locally, follow these steps:

1) Install the XAMPP software. XAMPP is a local Apache distribution that allows your local laptop or computer to serve as a web server.

2) Once XAMPP is installed, start up the XAMPP control panel and click "start" on Apache.

3) Save the code in this repository to C:/xampp/htdocs/NIHHIS

4) Open Chrome browser (or Safari, but works best in Chrome) and navigate to localhost/NIHHIS. The web tool should display and work fully.
